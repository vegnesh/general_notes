# Applied Predictive Models --  by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson

Goals of the book is to provide a guide for model building process and intuitive knowledge of the pros and cons of different modeling framework

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Common culprits for model failure are
1. Inadequate preprocessing of data
2. Overfitting
3. Unjustified extrapolation
4. Lack of model validation

### Prediction vs Intrepretation vs Intuition

Model accuracy must be coupled with expertise for best use of predictive models

### Terminology

1. Sample / data point / Observation / Instance
2. Training set, test set and validation set
3. Predictors, input, independent variables, attributes, descriptors
4. Outcome, dependent variable, target, class, response, output
5. Continuous data, count data (integers)
6. Categorical data (True of false)
7. Model buidling / training/ parameter estimation

### Dataset examples

1. [Music Genre](http://tunedit.org/challenge/music-retrieval/genres)
2. Grant Application (Kaggle)
3. Hepatic Injury - Drug effect on liver damage
4. Permeability of drugs
5. Chemical Manufacturing process
6. Fraudlent financial statements

Some of the problems with datasets:
Independent data samping, balanced or unbalanced responses, correlated predictors, scaling problems, sparsity of data
